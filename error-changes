Shell command expansions like $(...) do not work directly within ExecStart in systemd service files.
This is because systemd runs the ExecStart command directly, without a shell interpreter.
Therefore, the expression $(date +%H:%M:%S) was not processed by the shell but passed to xmessage as an incorrect parameter.

ERROR COMMAND:

 ```bash
[Unit]
Description= hourly time notification

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/timeout 10 /usr/bin/xmessage -center "$(date +%H:%M:%S)"
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOLUTION:

The command required to show the time was written in a small bash script (show-time.sh).

nano ~/.config/systemd/user/show-time.sh
```bash  #!/bin/bash
DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/timeout 10 /usr/bin/xmessage -center "$(date +%H:%M:%S)"
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then the service file (show-hourly.service) was re-edited. 
Edited version:

```bash
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/show-hourly.service // service dosyasÄ±
[Unit]
Description= hourly time notification
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/esmaerenesmaeren/.config/systemd/user/show-time.sh
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
If service files contain complex shell expressions (such as command expansion, pipe, && >, <) within ExecStart:
These expressions should be created by creating a small script file and running the generated file instead of typing them directly.
